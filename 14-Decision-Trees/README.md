## The Data

We will be using the same dataset through our discussions on classification with tree-methods (Decision Tree,Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees) in order to compare performance metrics across these related models.

We will work with the "Palmer Penguins" dataset, as it is simple enough to help us fully understand how changing hyperparameters can change classification results.

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

Summary:
The data folder contains two CSV files. For intro courses/examples, you probably want to use the first one (penguins_size.csv).

* penguins_size.csv: Simplified data from original penguin data sets. Contains variables:

    * species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)
    * culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
    * culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
    * flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
    * body_mass_g: body mass (g)
    * island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
    * sex: penguin sex

* (Not used) penguins_lter.csv: Original combined data for 3 penguin species  

Note: The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak" 

**Goal is to create a model that can help predict a species of a penguin based on physical attributes, then we can use that model to help researchers classify penguins in the field, instead of needing an experienced biologist**
