# Instructions

You're almost done with the lesson! There are just a couple more steps. In this exercise, you'll finish building the World Bank web app.

This exercise is inside the 4_flask+plotly+pandas_exercise folder. 

First, make sure plotly is installed in your workspace. Open a terminal and run `pip install plotly`.

Then, in the terminal, go into the 3_flask+plotly+pandas_exercise directory with 
`cd 4_flask+plotly+pandas_exercise`. You need to do this step in order to run the app properly.

In this exercise, you'll add a fifth visualization to the web app. You'll need to do two things:
1. wrangle the data and set up the visualization on the back end. You'll do this in the wrangle_data.py file following along the TODO sections
2. add an extra div in the index.html file where you want the visualization to show up. There will be a TODO section in the index.html file as well.

Remember to see the dashboard, you'll need to start the web app typing `python worldbank.py` in the terminal. 

Then you need to find the workspace environmental variables with `env | grep WORK`, and you can open a new browser window and go to the address:
`http://WORKSPACESPACEID-3001.WORKSPACEDOMAIN` replacing WORKSPACEID and WORKSPACEDOMAIN with your values.

You'll find a solution in the solutions folder. It's in the solutions/4_flask_exercise folder.
