# Instructions

It's time to write some html code. 

Go to the index.html file inside the 1_exercise_html folder and follow the instructions. You'll notice that as you type html into that file, the results appear on the right-hand side of the screen.

You'll see that you are asked to use a few html elements that were not discussed in the previous videos. This is done purposefully to give you the opportunity to look up the syntax yourself.

Because this is a crash course in web development, you'll need to search the internet for syntax examples if you want to go beyond what is shown in this course.

You'll see in the index.html file that html comments have the following syntax:

<!-- This is an html comment -->

When you're finished, there's a solution file in example_answer.html. Compare your code to the solution file.

Also, if you're wondering why the file is called index.html that is only because many servers automatically search for a file called index.html when serving a home page. It's a convention.
