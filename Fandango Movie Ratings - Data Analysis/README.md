# Project
## Overview

If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? *Especially* if the same company showing the rating *also* makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

### Goal:

**Based on the Fandango article (link below), let's determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.**
