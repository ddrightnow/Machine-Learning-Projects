Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you can identify those customers that are at risk of cancelling, you should know exactly what action to take for each individual customer to maximise the chances that the customer will remain.

Different customers exhibit different behaviours and preferences, so they cancel their subscriptions for various reasons. It is critical, therefore, to proactively communicate with each of them in order to retain them in your customer list. You need to know which  action will be the most effective for each and every customer, and when it will be most effective.
